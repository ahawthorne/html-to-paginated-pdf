Use case: You need to create a PDF.

Possible Solutions:
1. Do not create a PDF.
2. You still need to create a PDF. 

If you still need to create one, then you can possibly create it using HTML and print CSS. 

Controlling a document's page breaks, font rendering and margins is possible using the media type of print with CSS. However, browser's rendering engines do not follow these rules consistently by any means. The result is that printing a web page to PDF from a browser is most often pointless because of the quality of rendering.

In order to take advantage of print CSS declarations this program will take your web page via a URL. It will then respect the print CSS of the page and render it using one rendering engine (WebKit) on one platform (OS X) and return the rendered content as a PDF.

Requirements:

* OS X
* Connection to the Internets
